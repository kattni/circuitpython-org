    <h1>CircuitPython Libraries</h1>
    <p>
      The CircuitPython Library Bundle contains all current libraries available for
      CircuitPython. They are designed for use with CircuitPython and may or may not
      work with MicroPython. The bundle options are explained below.
    <p>
      CircuitPython libraries are separate files designed to work with CircuitPython code.
      CircuitPython programs require a lot of information to run. CircuitPython is so simple
      to use because most of this information is processed in the background and stored in
      libraries. Some libraries are built into CircuitPython. Others are downloaded and
      stored on your CIRCUITPY drive in a folder called lib.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full list of all the CircuitPython libraries contained in the following bundles
      can be found on the
      <a href="https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html" title="">libraries page</a>.

      <h2>Download and Installation Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        The libraries in each release are compiled to .mpy for all recent major versions
        of CircuitPython. Please download the bundle that matches the major version
        of your CircuitPython. For example, if you are running 6.0.0 you should
        download the 6.x bundle. The .mpy files are designed to take up less space on
        your CIRCUITPY drive. Unless you have a specific reason, choose the appropiate
        .mpy library bundle!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>To install</b>, download the appropriate bundle for your version of CircuitPython.
        Unzip the file, open the resulting folder and find the lib folder. Open the lib
        folder and find the library files you need to load. Create a lib folder on your
        CIRCUITPY drive. Copy the individual library files you need to the lib folder
        on your CIRCUITPY drive.
      </p>

            This bundle is the uncompiled source code for every library. It is not
            intended for general use! It is only recommended if you need to edit
            a library file. This bundle works with all versions of CircuitPython.

          <h3>Bundle Examples</h3>
          <p>
            Every CircuitPython library has examples to go along with it. This bundle
            contains every library example. This bundle will have examples that
            require the latest version of CircuitPython, and therefore contains files
            that may not work with all versions.
